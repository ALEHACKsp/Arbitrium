# Arbitrium
CS:GO Open Source Cheating Software written in C++ directed towards usage on the Windows 10 (x86_64) platform. Will also be used as a reverse-engineering 'sandbox' at times with ability to experiment with under-development methods by passing compiler directives.

# Goals
Arbitrium's primary goal is to be an easy to pick up cheat, to twist to one's own needs either by means of code or configuration, meant to be easy to understand/follow. It also follows a strict organization 'guideline' to section out code by relevancy for filter by usage of static libraries. Arbitrium aims to be experimental in the sense of both providing new approaches and, perhaps, creating unheard of functionality.
